pete is one of our primary nodes, as we are based in the NYC metro area.
It is currently hosted with Neptune Networks due to how expensive colocation is in the area; we checked. Its name is a reference to comedian Pete Davidson, as he is from Staten Island, which happens to also be where Neptune Networks' hardware is located (Telehouse Teleport).

This vps runs Alpine Linux, with the usual BIRDv2 and Pathvector.
