yeehaw is a vps rented from F4 Networks. It is located in NOCIX 1530 Swift, in Kansas City. It's called "yeehaw" because it's in the midwest, idk. I thought it was funny. We use it to connect to [F4IX](https://f4ix.com/) MCI. It may also host a looking glass at some point in the future.

In terms of 1530 Swift in general, depending on cost, we would like to explore connecting to KCIX either via VPS or via our own colocated hardware.
