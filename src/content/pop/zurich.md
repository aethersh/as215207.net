`zurich` is a [v6only](https://v6only.ch/en/vps-europe) VPS rented from iFog that we use to maintain presence in Europe. We are US-based, but we don't want to piss off our RIR. More recently we have acquired other Europe-based VPS' but this one will stay as FogIXP is valuable to us.

This VPS runs Debian with BIRDv2/Pathvector, and is connected to FogIXP.
