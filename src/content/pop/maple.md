maple is another one of our primary nodes, rented from Paradox Networks. It is also one of our single-most peered nodes, as we Ä§ave [ONIX](https://onix.cx) access through it. ONIX is the largest exchange that we are a part of.

This node also recieves free transit (via ONIX) from the lovely folks over at [Hurricane Electric](https://he.net).

It runs Alpine Linux with BIRDv2/Pathvector. The name is inspired by its location (Canada).
