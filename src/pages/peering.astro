        We do not have any prerequisites for peers regarding network size,
        minimum locations, etc. We only have the following requirements:
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside pt-2 space-y-2 px-3">
          <li>
            <b>IPv6:</b> Your network must be fully capable of passing IPv6 traffic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>PeeringDB:</b> You must have an updated PeeringDB page that reflects
            the current state of your network, including all PoPs, IXPs, and NOC
            contact information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Common Locations:</b> We must be able to peer at all common Internet
            Exchange Points. If you peer with route servers at these locations, we
            consider this requirement satisfied. However, we may reach out to request
            direct peering for routing optimization or other reasons. If you would
            like to arrange direct peering over an IXP, please do not hesitate to
            reach out. <i>We love peering!</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Routing Security:</b> You must have RPKI ROAs for all prefixes you
            announce. You must not leak routes or advertise invalid routes. Please
            do not point
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Settlement-free Peering:</b> We will not peer with networks that require
            payment for peering; in turn, we do not require payment for peering.
            This rule excludes transit providers who we specifically negotiate with.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Best-effort SLAs:</b> As Aethernet is a hobbynet, we do not guarantee
            minimum uptime or performance. If you encounter these types of problems,
            our NOC can respond to email within 48 hours at most. We also have a
            NOC phone number listed as well but request that you only use that if
            our network is threatening the stability of other networks. Contact details
            can be found on PeeringDB.
